# **Rogue Gym Website Project**

## **Overview**

The Rogue Gym website is a fully responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly platform designed to provide a seamless experience for users seeking information about fitness, memberships, and gym offerings. With features like a login system, light/dark theme toggle, and subscription pop-ups, this project demonstrates the integration of front-end design with practical JavaScript functionality.

## **Project Features**

### **1. Dynamic Login System**

- A login form is dynamically added via JavaScript.
- Users can log in, and their username is displayed next to the login button.
- Persistent login state is maintained using `localStorage`, ensuring users remain logged in across page reloads or navigation.

### **2. Light/Dark Mode Toggle**

- A theme toggle button (featuring a bulb icon) allows users to switch between light and dark modes.
- The toggle dynamically updates:
  - Text and background colors.
  - Maintains consistent styling for the primary red theme.
- User preferences are saved to `localStorage`, so the selected theme persists across sessions.

### **3. Subscription Pop-Up**

- A subscription form dynamically injects a pop-up to confirm email subscriptions.
- The userâ€™s email is displayed in the pop-up for confirmation.
- The pop-up can be closed via a button or by clicking outside the modal.

### **4. Responsive Design**

- The website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices.
- CSS variables (`:root`) and modern layout techniques (Flexbox) ensure scalability.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for easy accessibility and organization.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with variables for light/dark mode support.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- **LocalStorage**: Preserves user preferences and login state.
- **Google Fonts**: Clean typography to enhance readability.
- **SVG Icons**: Used for the light/dark mode toggle button.

---

## **Features Implemented**

### **Login System with Local Storage**

- **Description**: Users can log in, and their username is displayed dynamically in the header.
- **Technical Details**:
  - The login form is dynamically injected into the DOM via JavaScript.
  - Login state is preserved across pages using `localStorage`.

### **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**

- **Description**: Users can switch between light and dark modes using a bulb icon.
- **Technical Details**:
  - CSS variables are used to define `--text-color`, `--background-color`, and `--primary-color`.
  - JavaScript toggles a `light-theme` class on the `<body>`.
  - The theme preference is saved in `localStorage` for persistence across pages.

### **Subscription Pop-Up**

- **Description**: Users can enter their email into a subscription form, triggering a success pop-up.
- **Technical Details**:
  - The pop-up is dynamically added to the DOM and styled using CSS.
  - The pop-up shows the entered email and allows closing via buttons or overlay clicks.

## **HTML/CSS/JS Integration**

This project focuses on modular and reusable code:

1. **HTML**:
   - All forms and buttons are simple and minimal, relying on JavaScript for dynamic functionality.
2. **CSS**:
   - Variables (`--primary-color`, `--background-color`) ensure easy theme management.
   - Flexbox is used for layout responsiveness.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - Dynamically injects reusable components (e.g., login and subscription forms).
   - Manages localStorage to persist user settings and data across sessions.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rogue-gym.git
```

### **Step 2: Open in a Browser**

Navigate to the project folder and open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## **Challenges Faced**

1. **CSS Conflicts**:
   - Overlapping class names caused unexpected behavior in styling. The issue was resolved by giving unique class names to dynamically injected elements (e.g., `login-popup` and `subscription-popup`).
2. **Local Storage Integration**:
   - Initial issues with theme and login persistence across pages were resolved by ensuring `localStorage` was read and applied on `DOMContentLoaded`.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Google Sign-In Integration**:
   - Use the Google OAuth API for user authentication.
2. **Admin Panel**:
   - Add a backend system (e.g., Django) for managing gym memberships and subscriptions.
3. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Provide real-time stats on user engagement and subscriptions.
